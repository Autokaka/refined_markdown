Now support rendering the following grammar. Some of them may not work as you wish, I am trying my best to optimize it, please be patient.

- **bold text**

- _Italic text_

- <font color="orange">Syntax highlight</font>

- `code segment`

- ```dart
  // code blocks(including highlighting, using flutter_highlight. Thanks to pd4d10!)
  ```
